# Semi-Blackboard System Project

### Overview
This is a simple version of those (blackboard) systems you see in schools and colleges. The main idea is to help students and instructors manage stuff like courses and assignments, and to keep communication smooth between them.

### Features
- **Roles**: There are two main ones—Students and Instructors.
- **Login**: Basic login system so you know who’s who.
- **Course Management**: Instructors can create courses.
- **Assignments**: Instructors upload assignments Such as homework and projects., and students submit their work.

### Tech Stuff
- We built this using object-oriented design principles (fancy way of saying we kept things neat and organized).

### How to Use
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run it locally.
3. Log in as either a student or instructor.
4. Start managing courses or submitting assignments!

### Note
This is a simplified README file, and if there are any additions, it will be modified.
