# Semi-Blackboard System Project

## Overview

The **Semi-Blackboard System** is a lightweight, educational platform designed to facilitate course and assignment management for students and instructors. The goal is to create an accessible, user-friendly environment where students and instructors can efficiently manage academic tasks and communicate seamlessly.

## Features

### User Roles

- **Students**: Can log in, view enrolled courses, access and submit assignments, and communicate with instructors.
- **Instructors**: Can log in, create and manage courses, upload assignments (e.g., homework, projects), view submissions, and communicate with students.

### Functionalities

- **Login System**: A basic login system is implemented to distinguish between students and instructors, ensuring that users have access to relevant functionalities.
- **Course Management**: Instructors can create and manage courses, adding course-related resources and information as needed.
- **Assignment Management**:
    - Instructors upload assignments with due dates and descriptions.
    - Students can view assignments, upload submissions, and track their progress.
- **Communication**: Instructors and students can communicate within the platform, making it easier to clarify assignment details and course updates.

## Technical Details

This project is structured using **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** principles, promoting modularity and maintainability by organizing the code into classes representing the core entities like `Student`, `Instructor`, `Course`, and `Assignment`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. No additional libraries are needed, but you can add packages to `requirements.txt` if you expand functionality.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semi_blackboard_system.git
   cd semi_blackboard_system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any) with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Log in** as either a student or an instructor.
2. **Instructors** can create and manage courses, upload assignments, and view student submissions.
3. **Students** can view available courses, access assignments, and submit their work.

## Code Organization

Each feature is encapsulated within its own module, promoting reusability and scalability. Here’s a quick breakdown of the primary modules:

- **Student Module (`student.py`)**: Handles functionalities specific to students, such as course enrollment and assignment submissions.
- **Instructor Module (`instructor.py`)**: Contains functions for instructors to manage courses, assignments, and view student submissions.
- **Course Module (`course.py`)**: Defines the `Course` class and handles course-related operations.
- **Assignment Module (`assignment.py`)**: Manages assignment creation, deadlines, and submission tracking.

## Development

Feel free to contribute by forking the repository, making updates, and creating pull requests. For major changes, please open an issue to discuss the proposed updates.

### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semi_blackboard_system.git
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
4. **Make changes** and commit them.
5. **Push to your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a pull request**.

### Testing

Tests for each module are located in the `/tests` directory. Run the tests with:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced User Interface**: Add a graphical interface or web-based frontend.
- **Notification System**: Enable email or in-app notifications for assignment deadlines and updates.
- **Gradebook**: Implement a grading system for instructors to assess and return feedback to students.
- **File Uploads**: Allow students to upload various file formats as assignment submissions.
